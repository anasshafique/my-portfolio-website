            <h1>I'M ANAS SHAFIQ</h1>
            <h2>Aspiring Software Engineer</h2>
            <p> I am a Computer Science student at the University of Sunderland (Year 2) with interests in software engineering,
            web and mobile development, and AI. Skilled in C#, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Volunteering 
            with GDG Sunderland and The Developers Society,
            with experience in real-world projects.</p>

                    <h3>Fictional esports website</h3>
                    <p>Fictional Esports Website is a full-stack course work web project I developed during my first year of university. The platform is designed to showcase esports content and functionality using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, and MySQL. The frontend was built for responsive and modern user interaction, while the backend handles data management and dynamic features. I used AI assistance to help integrate the PHP backend with the frontend and ensure smooth database connectivity. This project reflects my early experience in full-stack development and building database-driven web applications.</p>

                    <h3>Car rental management system</h3>
                    <p>This project is a first-year, second-semester university coursework project. It is a console-based Car Rental Management System built in C# that allows users to register, log in securely, and book rental cars with optional extras.
                        The system applies basic Object-Oriented Programming concepts, including classes, file handling, input validation, and a menu-driven interface. Customer accounts, bookings, and rented car records are stored using text-based file management.
                        This project demonstrates my early experience in building structured, modular applications with authentication, pricing logic, and real-world booking functionality.</p>

                    <h3>Game Library & Player Statistics Manager</h3>
                    <p>The Game Library & Player Statistics Manager is a C# console application developed during my second year, second semester of university. The system is designed to manage player profiles, their game libraries, and performance statistics, allowing activity tracking such as hours played and high scores across different games.

                        This project demonstrates key computer science concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data structures, searching and sorting algorithms, and file persistence, showcasing my ability to design structured, data-driven applications.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
            
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>My journey into Computer Science started with a strong curiosity about how technology actually works behind the scenes. During my engineering foundation year, I developed a solid analytical mindset through mathematics and physics, which naturally led me toward software development. Since then, I've enjoyed challenging myself with new concepts, solving problems step by step, and continuously pushing my skills further. I've become comfortable working with HTML, CSS, and C#, and I'm currently expanding my knowledge by learning Python and JavaScript. I see learning as a long-term journey, and I genuinely enjoy the process of improving every day.</p>
                
                <p>Being involved in the tech community has become an important part of my growth. I currently serve as an Events Manager for both the Developers Society on campus and GDG Sunderland, where I help organise workshops, coding sessions, and technical events that bring people together to learn and share ideas. I'm also a PASS Leader, supporting first-year Computer Science students through mentoring sessions, study guidance, and interactive learning activities. These experiences have helped me grow as a communicator and leader, and they've shown me how powerful collaboration and support can be in helping others build confidence and succeed.</p>
                
                <p>Looking ahead, I want to develop into a software engineer who builds meaningful, user-focused technology that solves real problems. I'm especially motivated by opportunities that challenge me to think creatively, work with talented people, and apply my skills in practical environments. My long-term goal is to grow into a versatile developer who can adapt, innovate, and contribute to projects that make a genuine difference in people's lives.</p>
